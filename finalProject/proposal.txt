"Your project proposal should include a general description of your project and give some initial speculation about these five topics:

	1. concrete goals for your project, and methods of testing and verification you will apply to determine whether those goals were met.
	2. a discussion of your project's effect on its user population, and the user support issues it might raise.
	3. a discussion of security issues relevant to your project
	4. a discussion of the work needed to complete the project and what might be needed to maintain it for continued future use
	5. documentation of the project, both for the system administration work involved and for your user community
